# Ticket Tracker
I created this ticket tracker as part of the Nology Software Development course. I was required to build an app completely in React, that would keep track of the number of tickets that my fictional co-workers had completed, incorporating their data and a counter.

# What I used:
•	JavaScript
•	React
•	SCSS
•	BEM
•	GitHub

# The Design
The requirements for this build were such that it should be built in React, each component should manage its own state, and that the components should be generated using a map(). Once I had created the Employee cards I was free to style the app as I wanted using SCSS.

# The Process
When it came to creating Ticket Tracker, I took a step-by-step process as outlined below:
1.	Create the components that I needed (Counter, EmployeeCard, NavBar)
2.	Map over the data file provided to create all the components
3.	Pass the data into the components via props
4.	Use State to handle the increment and decrement of the tickets
5.	Style the app however I saw fit with sass
